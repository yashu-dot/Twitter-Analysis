    "The objective of this project is to train a classifier for predicting the sentiment of a tweet. You are only allowed to use the standard python library (including python regular expression library) along with the matplotlib, pandas, and numpy libraries to implement the code. No other library functions are allowed (except for tqdm to monitor progress of your program execution). You must use the Jupyter notebook template provided here to write your program. Rename the notebook as **project_yourlastname.ipynb** and submit it to D2L. "

If you're running the code on a smaller machine, you can limit your analysis to 50,000 or 100,000 tweets by setting the appropriate numTweets parameter below. However, the smaller the number of tweets, the more likely your classifier may overfit the training data and achieves slightly lower accuracy."

    "To do this, you need to write a function named `checkTweet` that checks whether a tweet contains a particular word token. If so, the function should return the value 1. Otherwise, it returns the value 0. You can use the python regular expression library function re.search() to do this. You may refer to the examples given in https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions.\n",

    "You will apply the function to determine whether a tweet message contains a `hashtag`, a `mention`, or a `URL`. Note that each hashtag begins with the character `#`, each mention begins with the character `@`, while each URL begins with the prefix `http`. You need to be careful when specifying the regular expression pattern to search for in a string since the special characters such as `#` or `@` do not always appear at the beginning of the word token. For example, email addresses like `cse840@msu.edu` also contains an `@` character but should not be counted as a tweet mention.\n",

    "This step requires you to implement a fully-connected neural network of arbitrary depth to solve the classification problem. For each layer you will implement a `forward` and a `backprop` function  separately. The `forward` function will receive inputs from previous layer, alongside with models parameters and will return an output for next layer and also store the data needed for the backward pass in a cache object. The `backprop` function receives the gradients from its next layer and use them to compute the gradients with respect to the inputs and weights. The last layer of the network is a fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation function. The network should be trained to minimize the cross entropy loss function. For all other hidden layers of the network, the user can specify the number of hidden nodes and type of activation function as hyper-parameters."
